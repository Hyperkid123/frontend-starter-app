# Components Container Requirements

## Overview
Replace the current stacked component layout with a sophisticated grid-based layout system using react-grid-layout.

## Current State
- Components are currently stacked vertically using PatternFly Stack component
- All components have the same width and appear in a single column
- No flexibility in positioning or sizing

## Requirements

### 1. React Grid Layout Integration
- [ ] Install and integrate `react-grid-layout` package
- [ ] Replace current Stack-based layout with grid layout
- [ ] Implement responsive grid system

### 2. Grid Layout Features
- [ ] Support draggable components for repositioning
- [ ] Support resizable components with handles
- [ ] Multiple breakpoints for responsive behavior
- [ ] Automatic collision detection and prevention

### 3. Layout Management
- [ ] Save and restore layout configurations
- [ ] Support for different layout presets
- [ ] Ability to reset to default layout

### 4. Component Integration
- [ ] Ensure existing components work seamlessly in grid cells
- [ ] Maintain component loading states and animations
- [ ] Handle dynamic component addition/removal

### 5. User Experience
- [ ] Smooth animations during drag/resize operations
- [ ] Visual feedback during layout changes
- [ ] Intuitive resize handles and drag indicators

### 6. Performance
- [ ] Optimize for large numbers of components
- [ ] Efficient re-rendering during layout changes
- [ ] Memory management for layout persistence

## Technical Notes
- Use `react-grid-layout` as the primary grid engine
- Maintain existing Framer Motion animations where appropriate
- Preserve current component loading and error states
- Ensure compatibility with existing ScalprumComponent system

## Acceptance Criteria
- Components can be dragged to new positions
- Components can be resized using handles
- Layout adapts to different screen sizes
- Performance remains smooth with multiple components
- Integration doesn't break existing functionality
